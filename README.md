My web portfolio, WorkBucket, is developed using a combination of tools and technologies. It leverages HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development, and PHP for server-side scripting. The data is stored and managed efficiently with a MySQL database, ensuring secure and reliable storage. In addition, I have utilized the Laravel framework to streamline the development process and enhance the functionality of the website. WorkBucket is the culmination of my expertise in web development, bringing together these tools to benefit job seekers in their career search.
